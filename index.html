        <p>I am an avid enthusiast of all things written, whether I read them or write them myself. I have been writing since technically third grade, though those pieces will never see the eyes of anyone else, as they truly suck. I enjoy reading all genres, though my top picks gear toward dystopian, science-fiction, fantasy, and historical fiction. Similar to my reading preferences, I love to write anything and everything, though I am partial to fiction, given that that was the genre that made me fall in love with literature. Outside reading and writing, I enjoy exercising, hiking (especially with my dog), biking, and watching movies.</p>
        <p>My goal is to one day be a self-sustaining published author. Hopefully, I will have a rapport of many kinds of writing, from fiction novels to academic articles to poetry even. Until that day comes, which can take years to decades, I will be content to achieve in any job within the writing world, from magazines to publishing to communication divisions in companies.</p>

        <p>I graduated from University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire in December of 2022. There, I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in English-Creative Writing, minor in Multimedia Communication, and double certificate in Rhetorics of Science, Technology, and Culture and Critical Studies in Literatures, Cultures, and Film.</p>
        <p>Throughout my youth, I've done a myriad of grunt jobs, including working at an apple orchard, a winery vineyard, a campus bookstore, a production factory, and a gas station. In relation to my field of study, I've worked at my campus' writing center as a tutor, an internship with Eau Claire's local magazine Volume One, and an internship with Eau Claire's literary organizaiton, Chippewa Valley Writers Guild. My work has been published in my campus' literary booklet NOTA (None Of The Above) and in the two aforementioned internships' publications.</p>
